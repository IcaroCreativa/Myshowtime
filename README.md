# Ticket Booking Website

This is a ticket booking website for concerts and festivals, developed as a project for the full-stack developer program at EPITECH school. It consists of a frontoffice for users to browse and book tickets, and a backoffice for administrators to manage the concert schedule and view booking statistics.

##Frontoffice Functionalities (for users)

## Requirements
Install NestJs, and an account in MongoDB atlas. You have to create cluster with collections: users, concerts, bands (see the schema folder to see the items you need to create in every collection)
